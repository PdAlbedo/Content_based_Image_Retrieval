cbir.cpp: main program
data.csv: stores the feature info
matching.cpp/matching.h: includes all functions used in cbir.cpp


Operating system: Windows 11
IDE: vscode
code-runner execute command: "cd $dir && g++ $fileName matching.cpp -o $fileNameWithoutExt -std=c++14 -I D:\\CodeAndTools\\OpenCV\\opencv\\build\\include -I D:\\CodeAndTools\\OpenCV\\opencv\\build\\include\\opencv2 -L D:\\CodeAndTools\\OpenCV\\opencv\\build\\x64\\MinGW\\lib -l opencv_core455 -l opencv_core455 -l opencv_imgproc455 -l opencv_imgcodecs455 -l opencv_video455 -l opencv_ml455 -l opencv_highgui455 -l opencv_objdetect455 -l opencv_flann455 -l opencv_imgcodecs455 -l opencv_photo455 -l opencv_videoio455 && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt"


Procedure of running cbir.cpp:

1. Enter the path of image that user wants to use as a target image
